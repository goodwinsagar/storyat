<p>The sun is setting down, but not the social rift.<br />
My shadow is facing me, and I can't even face my grief.</p>

<p>The dark cast of mine tells me â€œitâ€™s the time, rise up or be ready to be a mere spectator in the cityâ€
<br />â€œBut what can I do?â€ yelling, I asked my shadow.
</p>

<p>â€œLook at me human, my stature is taller than you, though I am nothing without youâ€
</p>

<p>â€œLook at the firing gaze, this is setting down, but this doesn't mean it will never rise again! <br />and when it rises, with it comes the new chance and opportunity to change the bad phaseâ€
</p>

<p>"Come on humans donâ€™t make it too late, <br /> 
the clock is ticking and so does the wait, the wait of a responsible human" said my shadow
</p>

<p>My dim eyes fired with hope, capturing confidence, I gripped my feast hard enough it would never escape again.
</p>

<p>I faced the setting fire and stared at the glooming eyes around me, with hope in it, hope of change in their faith.
</p>

<p>The sky was turning dark, my shadow was disappearing, and before it did, I made a change</p>
<strong>Filling those hopeful eyes with actual reality is the oath to my shadow</strong>
