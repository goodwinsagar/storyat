I"õ<p>â€œItâ€™s 1:30 PM, we are late,â€ I said.<br />
â€œNo, we arenâ€™t,â€ my sister said.<br />
We planned to visit our mamaâ€™s house. <br /></p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Exactly at 2:30, after having our launch we went down. We were going out after 3-4 months and excited about it. I stepped on the front seat, My jija-ji sat on the driving seat my sister and mummy sat back. We were adjusted on the seats. As we held our excitement, my jija-ji revved the engine, and as the car moved we all were the free birds who ran out of their shelter. My Mother, who was sitting back was unable to hide the delighted face she had. From there we were heading towards my cousinâ€™s sisterâ€™s(my mamaâ€™s daughter) place so that we could pick her and then ultimately land at mama which would take around 1 hour hoping the traffic would be less because of the applied lockdown. The journey started. I was expecting an empty road but I was fortunate to see people on the streets. Since it was a normal day right? (â€œlockdown! What you mean there was a lockdownâ€). I set some high expectations. So as we drove forward we saw most of the shops were still open. Precisely small shops. But, I canâ€™t argue on this. So heading at the main road we were delighted to see a restaurant, properly running, where people were sitting and eating the food. My face was in awe. I am in the pre-corona era? The area was nevertheless a corona affected one. Vehicles were surfing on the roads. I thought it was just us living a different life because others seem to live regular lives, hmm at least on roads.<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â So after 30 minutes, we reached my cousinâ€™s place. We picked her â€œLetâ€™s GO!â€. and then soon we were stuck in 10 minutes of traffic. Believe me, traffic is the best place to have a political, filmy, and justice society kind of discussion, as those 3 ladies sitting back were doing. After an hour we finally reached mamaâ€™s place. The security guard was checking the visitorâ€™s body temperature. We saw it from a distance and wore our mask back like a thief. The car moved and stoped near the gate. Like others, we also got the same treatment. The guards checked our temperature too and permitted us the entry. My cousin guided us to the room.<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€œHi, mama!â€ We greeted him and with a subtle smile made way for us to enter. We settled down. Cousin went into the kitchen and brought drinking water in transparent glasses. The 4 oâ€™clock ray coming from the balcony passed through the glass and made it looked like a crystal.<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â They have a good sky view from the 8th floor. After sitting for a while I went to the balcony. The cloud freshened my tired eyes. The clouds seemed very huge tough we were on the 8th floor. I looked below, I thought if I look for 10 minutes more than I will have vertigo. So I stopped staring down. In front, there was a little farm-like thing that I could easily see. The area was on the outskirts, a kind of village but the buildings which were under construction gave the sign that it is going to be the main city area at least in the next 10 years. I immediately took the photo of the clouds, the high buildings, and of course some quick selfies. I went inside again.<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Mama was busy showing the aquarium and the newborns. He breeds them like a mother. And also introduced to each fish like he was introducing us to his children.<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â The evening rays started to rip through the sky. I took a lookout. It was snack time so my cousin went into the kitchen and brought a bowl cewdha, some chips in a plate and chai, three sugarless, and three with sugar. I took a sip and went to the balcony again. The orange flare was calling me out. â€œOHHHâ€ my eyes popped up. The scenery I was viewing was just incredible. It was like I am watching a live movie, a dark city at night and batman will climb from nowhere for the surveillance. In enthusiasm, I called my sister to witness the beautiful view. She came and just dropped expressions like me when she saw the skies. She immediately shot some selfies. But I was not less than her, not selfies but some images of the beautiful orange sky. Then we went inside. It was 7 PM. So we decided to leave. After leaving greeting we left.<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â The left the gate building. By now it was dark outside. Still, the shops were open, but no surprise. Since the shops were open, people were out. And I found a matching trait, all shopkeepers wore the mask, Good! until you find out that they are wearing below the nose or just hanging as an earpiece on an ear. It was funny but at the same time concerning. On the way, we dropped my cousin and reached home around 9:30.<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â After a long time, we made an outing like this. We ordered food from Swiggy. And after finishing dinner I went to bed. Lying on the bed I was thinking about the day and came across an interesting leaning. We people are complex. We follow rules and also break them. As itâ€™s said. â€œRules are meant to be breakâ€. Today when we went out after a long time, we saw a running restaurant, a few small open shops, people buying selling without any concern of corona, a lot of vehicles, and lastly a very regular life.<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â I used to think I am obeying the rule(the lockdown), but as we stepped out for no emergency reason, I guess we also broke it. I was spectacle about the shopkeepers who were running the shops even in the lockdown. What made them run their shop and what made the buyers come out. After lockdown, we ordered online. So canâ€™t they. But wait. I thought something, me who has enough internet where even if I stream youtube videos all day itâ€™s not gonna exhaust, found that every person is not connected to the internet. Not every shopkeeper has its saving left to run their household. And not every person can stand in front of a wide-open sky to get the best selfie. Each person has their own story, their happiness, and their problems. We canâ€™t rant on someone because what you expect is not what you get. Sometimes not bothering is the best decision. Let the living shape life not the bothering. But that doesnâ€™t mean that one canâ€™t run a shop without any precaution.<br /><br />
â€œThe act you do must be free form all bothering still bother about the deed you may face in the future.â€
I said we people are complex.</p>
